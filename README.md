📘 Engineering Unit Converter

BMKT 1723 – Computer Programming (Group Assignment)


📌 Project Overview

The Engineering Unit Converter is a web-based application developed to demonstrate how fundamental programming concepts learned in C++ can be applied in a modern web environment.

This application allows users to convert common engineering units such as length, mass, force, energy, and temperature. The system also records frequently used conversions automatically using browser local storage.

The project is hosted using GitHub Pages and developed with the assistance of AI tools, as permitted by the course guidelines.


🎯 Learning Objectives

This project aims to:

- Demonstrate understanding of core programming concepts

- Apply problem-solving skills in a practical application

- Gain exposure to web development tools and workflows

- Improve technical explanation and presentation skills
  

⚙️ Features

- Convert between multiple engineering units:

  Length (cm, mm, m, km),Mass (kg, g),Force (Newton),Energy (Joule),Temperature (°C, Kelvin)

- Separate original unit and target unit

- Automatic calculation using selection logic

- Tracks frequent used conversions automatically

- Stores data using localStorage

- Reset frequent conversion history

- Simple and user-friendly interface

  🧠 Programming Concepts Applied

1. Selection: if–else statements

2. Functions: conversion and navigation logic

2. Arrays / Objects: frequent used unit tracking

3. Input validation: numerical input checking

4. Data persistence: browser localStorage

All concepts are directly related to C++ fundamentals.

🤖 AI Usage Documentation
AI Tools Used :

- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

1. Purpose of AI Usage 

AI tools were used to:

- Generate initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code

- Suggest logical program structure

- Assist in implementing unit conversion formulas

- Help design localStorage-based data persistence

- Improve code readability and documentation

2. Example AI Prompts Used :

- “Create a simple engineering unit converter using HTML and JavaScript”

- “How to store frequent user actions using localStorage”

- “Explain how JavaScript if–else logic relates to C++ selection statements”

- “Add reset functionality for stored data”

3. Modifications Made to AI-Generated Code :

- Simplified logic to match beginner-level understanding

- Adjusted unit conversions to ensure correctness

- Separated original unit and target unit selection

- Improved variable naming for clarity

- Removed advanced features not covered in the course

- Ensured code aligns with C++ programming concepts
