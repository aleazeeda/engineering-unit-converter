📘 Engineering Unit Converter

BMKT 1723 – Computer Programming (Group Assignment)

📌 Project Overview

The Engineering Unit Converter is a web-based application developed to demonstrate how fundamental programming concepts learned in C++ can be applied in a modern web environment.

This application allows users to convert common engineering units such as length, mass, force, energy, and temperature. The system also records frequently used conversions automatically using browser local storage.

The project is hosted using GitHub Pages and developed with the assistance of AI tools, as permitted by the course guidelines.
